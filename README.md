# Garcia_Ngau_Zomato_SQL

## Project
 Selected from the project ideas listed in the "Final Project Description" document posted under the blackboard "Assignments" section
 Zomato Restaurants: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data
 
## Approach
First, we would like to work on the dataset that we will download from Kaggle. We will then use python to do exploratory data analysis on the dataset to see the type and distribution of each variable. Since we are working in a group, we would like to complete our python code on the Google Colab environment so that both of us can change or add stuff at the same time. 
Once we have a better understanding of the dataset, we plan to build an entity-relationship model to design the architecture of the database. This will allow us to have a clear vision of our database 
Then we will build and distribute the different tables by using the pyMySQL environment. 
One analysis we expect to work on is to visualize the data based on their location, cuisine, price, and ratings. The final goal would be to provide an efficient and easier way for end-users to search for specific information.
